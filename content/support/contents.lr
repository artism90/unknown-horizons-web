Please note, that the [FIFE version](https://github.com/unknown-horizons/unknown-horizons) of Unknown Horizons is no longer supported. You can ask for help about crashes, but it is unlikely that we can do anything about it.

We are working on a [Godot version](https://github.com/unknown-horizons/godot-port/), but that one isn't playable yet.
